    <p>
        We will now conduct another experiment. This experiment lasts at least 3 periods, in which you
        and the other group members have to make decisions. As in the other experiment, every
        group consists of {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} people. The formation of the group changes at random after every period.
        So your group consists of different people in all periods. The whole experiment is
        finished after this session.
    </p>

    <p>
        The decision situation is the same as s the unconditional contribution of the previous experiment.
        Each member of the group has to decide about the usage of the 20
        tokens. You can put these 20 tokens into your private account or you can invest them fully or
        partially to the project. Each token you do not invest into the project is automatically placed
        into your private account. Your income will be determined in the same way as before.
        Reminder:
    </p>
    <p>
        Income in a round = (20 - tokens you contribute) + 0.4 * total contribution to the project
    </p>
    <p>
        The decision screen, which you will see in every period, looks like this:

        <img src="{{ static 'task3.PNG' }}"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        You need to decide on your contribution to the project, that is, you have to decide
        how many of the 20 tokens you want to contribute to the project, and how many tokens
        you want to put into your private account. This decision is the same as the unconditional
        contribution of the previous experiment. You only make unconditional decisions in this
        experiment. There is no contribution table.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each run you will receive payoff and feedback information after all the group members have made their decisions.
        After session two is over, the whole experiment is finished and you will receive:
        <ul> + your income from session one </ul>
        <ul> + your income from session two (including every period of your decision) </ul>
        <ul> = total income from both experiments </ul>
        <ul> + participation fee </ul>
    </p>
