    <p>
        Welcome and thank you for participating in this experiment. Please turn off your phones and do not talk to other
        participants. If you have a question, please raise your hand, and the experimenter will come and answer you privately.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, you can earn money except for the participation fees. Your final earnings will depend on your
        own decisions and the decisions of other participants.
        During the experiment, your earnings will express in tokens that will be converted at the end of the experiment in
        dollars: 1 Token = $0.15.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will learn how the experiment will be conducted later. We first introduce you to the
        basic decision situation. You will find control questions after the instruction that help you to understand the
        decision situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be randomly and privately assigned to a group of {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }}.
        In each round, you will receive {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} tokens and you must decide how many tokens to contribute in a
        project; you can contribute any number between 0 and {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} tokens. Your income in each round
        consists of the number of tokens you kept for yourself plus 0.4 times the total number of tokens contributed to
        the project. That is:
    </p>

    <p>
        Income in a round = (20 - tokens you contribute) + 0.4 * total contribution to the project
    </p>

    <p>
<!--        For each token you put-->
<!--        on your private account, you will receive exactly one token. The group account produces 1.6 tokens for each token-->
<!--        contributed, and all members of the group receive the same return from the group account. -->
        This is because the project produces 1.6 tokens for each token contributed, and all members of the group receive
        the same return from the project (1.6/4 = 0.4).
        For example, if the total contribution is 60 tokens, then you and all other members of the group receive
        60 × 0.4 = 24 tokens from the project. If you had contributed 15 tokens, then your income in that round would be
        (20 − 15) + 24 = 29 tokens. If, on the other hand, you had contributed 5 tokens to the project, your income in that
        round would be (20 − 5) + 24 = 39 tokens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your earnings from private account are independent of the decisions of other group members. Your earnings from
        the project depend on the decisions of all group members. No matter how many tokens you contribute to the project,
        you will always receive your share equally.
