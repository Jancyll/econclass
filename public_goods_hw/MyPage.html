        You have {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} tokens in your private account P.
        You can decide how you would like to allocate the {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} between your private account P
        and group account G.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each token you put on your private account P, you will receive exactly one token.
        For each token you put on the group account G, it will multiply by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The resulting amount of tokens on account G will be divided equally among four group members.
        You will receive the payoff from both private account P and your share of the group account G.
