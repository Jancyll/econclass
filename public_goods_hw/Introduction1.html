    <p>
        The experiment includes the decision situation just described to you. As you know, you will have 20 tokens at
        your disposal. You can put them into a private account or you can invest them into a project. Each subject has to
        make two types of decisions in session one, which we will refer to below as the
        “unconditional contribution” and “contribution table”. This session
        will only be conducted once.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You decide how many of the 20 tokens you want to invest into the project in the unconditional contribution.
        You will indicate your contribution in the following screen: </li>

        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Your second task is to fill in a “contribution table” where you indicate how many tokens
        you want to contribute to the project for each possible average contribution of the
        other group members (rounded to the next integer). You can condition your contribution
        on that of the other group members. This will be immediately clear to you if you take a
        look at the following table. This table will be presented to you in the experiment (The full table will include
            average contribution from 0 to 20):  </li>

        <img src="{{ static 'global/task2.PNG' }}"/>
       <img src="https://github.com/Jancyll/econclass/blob/master/_static/global/task2.PNG" width="500px" />

        The numbers are the possible (rounded) average contributions of the other group members to
        the project. You simply have to insert how many tokens you will contribute to the project into
        each input box – conditional on the indicated average contribution. You have to make an
        entry into each input box. For example, you will have to indicate how much you contribute
        to the project if the others contribute 0 tokens to the project, how much you contribute if the
        others contribute 1, 2, or 3 tokens, etc. You can insert any integer numbers from 0 to 20 in
        each input box.
    </ul>

    <p>
        After all participants of the experiment have made an unconditional contribution and have
        filled in their contribution table, a random mechanism will select a group member from every
        group. Only the contribution table will be the payoff-relevant decision for the randomly
        determined subject. Only the unconditional contribution will be the payoff-relevant
        decision for the other three group members not selected by the random mechanism. For example, assume that the random mechanism selects you. This implies that your
        payoff-relevant decision will be your contribution table. The unconditional contribution is the
        payoff-relevant decision for the other three group members. Assume that the random mechanism did not select you,
        implying that the unconditional contribution is taken as the payoff-relevant decision for you and two other
        group members.
    </p>

    <p>
        You obviously do not know whether the random mechanism will select you when you make your
        unconditional contribution and when you fill in the contribution table. You will therefore
        have to think carefully about both types of decisions because both can become relevant for
        you.
